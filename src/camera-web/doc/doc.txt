image hub

"""
Opens a zmq socket and receives images

Opens a zmq (REP or SUB) socket on the hub computer, for example,
a Mac, that will be receiving and displaying or processing OpenCV images
and related text messages. Provides methods to receive images or receive
jpg compressed images.

Two kinds of ZMQ message patterns are possible in imagezmq:
REQ/REP: an image is sent and the sender waits for a reply ("blocking").
PUB/SUB: an images is sent and no reply is sent or expected ("non-blocking").

There are advantabes and disadvantages for each message pattern.
See the documentation for a full description of REQ/REP and PUB/SUB.
The default is REQ/REP for the ImageSender class and the ImageHub class.

Arguments:
    open_port: (optional) the socket to open for receiving REQ requests or 
        socket to connect to for SUB requests.
    REQ_REP: (optional) if True (the default), a REP socket will be created
        if False, a SUB socket will be created
