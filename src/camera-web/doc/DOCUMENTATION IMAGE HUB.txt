DOCUMENTATION IMAGE HUB

"""
    Initializes zmq socket to receive images and text.
    Expects an appropriate ZMQ socket at the senders tcp:port address:
    If REQ_REP is True (the default), then a REP socket is created. It
    must connect to a matching REQ socket on the ImageSender().
    If REQ_REP = False, then a SUB socket is created. It must connect to
    a matching PUB socket on the ImageSender().
"""
